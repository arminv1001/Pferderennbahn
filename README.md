# Horse race

This project aims to simulate a horse race with betting stakes. A rider can register their horse at a racetrack, and from these registrations, race schedules are automatically created, with each race featuring up to ten rider-horse pairs. However, a race can still take place with just five pairs. Only one rider-horse pair per club can participate on any given race day. In addition to the riders, spectators can enter the arena. To watch the races, an entrance fee of 5â‚¬ must be paid. The arena has a limited capacity, which cannot be exceeded. Spectators can also place bets at the betting office and view the odds, which are determined by the amount of money in the pot and the amount bet on each horse. The pot is collected separately for each race. When purchasing a betting ticket, spectators receive a voucher for each bet, which they can redeem after the race to collect their winnings if their chosen pair finishes in first place. The personal details of the ticket purchasers are recorded, a receipt is printed as proof, and the information is entered into the system. The organization (Orga) manages the registrations, handles the race schedule, and oversees the race proceedings, while receiving all signals from the arena.
